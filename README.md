Clustering using Self-Organizing Maps through Non-Linear Principal Components Analysis - Rainfalls in Southwestern Colombia

### ABSTRACT

The knowledge of rainfall regimes is a prerequisite necessary for many activities such as water resources management, mitigation of risks, planning of socioeconomic activities and other hydrologic applications. In this paper, the use of non-linear principal component analysis (NLPCA) and self-organized feature map (SOM), as non-linear techniques are applied to identify the homogenous regions for monthly rainfall in the southwestern of Colombia. SOM was applied to a network of 44 monthly rainfall gauge stations represent in five principal components using NLPCA. The NLPCA coefficients represent the dimension reduction in the period from January of 1983 to December of 2016 into five principal components for each gauge station. The two-dimensional SOM indicates that rainfall gauges can be grouped into two clusters. A heterogeneity test showed that the two regions are acceptably homogeneous and depict the main features of the monthly rainfall variability over the study area. Besides, both identified clusters show two types of rainfall regime: bimodal in the Andean Region and unimodal in the Pacific Region. The bimodal regimes predominate in the mountainous area and the unimodal regime over the coastal zone. The application of SOM provided a better understanding of the seasonality and spatiality of rainfall.
The advantages of NLPCA and SOM are three points:
-	The application of NLPCA allows the reduction of dimensions and extraction of the main features of rainfall datasets.
-	SOM is an artificial neural network useful for the classification and identification of homogeneous climate zones.
-	The combination of NLPCA and SOM is an efficient approach for the classification of monthly rainfall in southwestern Colombia.
